### I use Arch btw :exploding_head:

I'm a final year undergrad at UCSD studying molecular biology and math. **I'm currently applying to PhD programs!** If you're in the systems/synthetic/computational biology space, I probably want to work with you. Feel free to email me at ```xsnvmv@hpfq.rqh``` (ROT13) and let's talk science!

Likes: quantitative biology, open source/science, self-hosting

Dislikes: fossil fuels, adtech monopolies, nuclear proliferation
